## Blazor Preview Application
This project was started as a test of the (back then) newly released and almost complete version of blazor (C# | ASP.NET core | WASM) preview.

The goal was to investigate the use of C# and the mono 2.0 framework in the browser as a client -side infrastructure tool for ASP.NET Core applications. I originally wanted to see how this would work as a widget creation tool for say something like Umbraco since Umbraco doesn't have this type of functionality like Kentico, some WordPress instances, and some Drupal instances.
